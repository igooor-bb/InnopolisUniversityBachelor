## Avoidance
    Pros
        - No roll-back of the process required
    Cons
        - Safe state checking overhead
        - Future resource requirements must be known
        - Processes can be blocked for long periods

## Prevention
    Pros:
        - Suitable where roll-back is impossible or expensive
    Cons:
        - Inefficient due to preemtion or low resource utilization
        
## Recovery 
    Pros:
        - Maximum concurrency and resource utilization
    Cons:
        - Roll-back
        - Cycle checking overhead even if it is not deadlocked
