Execution with O_SYINC is slower, beacuse when you open using O_SYNC, the data must go all the way to disk on 
every write call. When you don't use O_SYNC, then the kernel is able to combine writes in the cache. 
Therefore, you end up with fewer accesses to the physical disk, which makes execution much faster.
